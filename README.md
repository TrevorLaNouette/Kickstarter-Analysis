# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to create a play called "Fever" and would like for us to find the best circumstances to gather enough funding to make her play succeed.

### Purpose
To compare different campaigns based on launch dates and funding goals to find their rate of outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to find the outcome rate based on launch dates I needed to first organize the data of theater launch months. I removed the live campaigns from the data set so that we could look at information that would yield a final outcome. I organized the monthly data in descending order from highest number of successful campaigns to lowest. I then turned this data into a line graph to visualize the outcomes by month.

I analyzed this further by finding the success rate of campaigns by month.  I did this by dividing the total number of successful campaigns in each month by the total number of campaigns. 
To find outcomes rates based on the goal amount of the campaigns we needed to find the number of each outcome “Successful, Failed, and Canceled” for each goal range. The goals amounts were sectioned into 12 separate goal ranges. I then counted the number of outcomes that fit into each goal range. Once I compiled that data I was able to find the rate of each outcome by dividing the outcome count for each range by the total number of projects in each range.

I created the above line graph to display the success rate based on the goal amount range of each campaign.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This graph illustrated that the month with the highest number of successful campaigns was in May.

Based on the table above, further analysis showed that May also had the highest rate of success for a launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This graph shows that the highest rate of success for campaigns falls in the goal range of less than $1,000 yielded a success rate of 75.81%. 
However, if your campaign needs more than $999 to fund your project it may be necessary to ask for more money. The best comparative outcome rate in regard to goals of more significant amounts of money was in the $40,000 to $44999 range which yielded a success rate of 66.67%
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges in this project was to decide on the goal amount to suggest as we did not know the estimated amount of money required for the campaign. If this estimate was given I would have been able to give a more precise answer as to what the goal amount should be in order to ensure the highest success rate to match the required funds.

## Results

- In order to maximize the success rate the campaign should be launched in May (67%). The second best month based on success rate would be June (65%).

- The highest rate of success based on goal was less than $1000 (75.81%). Depending on the amount of funds necessary to carry out the campaign it may require significantly more money. Thus, asking for $40,000- $44,999 would yield the most return with a relatively high success rate (66.67%). So again, this would depend on the financial estimates of the campaign cost.

- The estimated required funds to carry out the campaign was not presented in the data set. 
The analysis of outcomes based on launch date was based on number of outcomes and not as a rate of success which would be a more accurate predictor of the best launch month.

- I was able create the table below to display the success rate based on month to find the success rates by month rather than number of outcomes as a better metric to more accurately determine which month had the highest rate of successful campaigns.
